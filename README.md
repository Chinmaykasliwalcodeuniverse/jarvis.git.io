Basic Personal Assistant
Main class in this project is PersonalAssistant(code). This class represent voice personal assistant with basic features. The basic implemented features are:

introduce yourself
convert text to speech
handle microphone input
welcome you, different greeting depending on the time of day
tell a joke
shutdown computer
say goodbye
A lot of phrases which personal assistant will tell are hard coded so I decided to create simple enum class called BasicPhrases(code). This is very simple class, which only purpose is to store messages, which will be said by personal assistant.

Jarvis
Jarvis(code) inherits after PersonalAssistant class and provide extra features:

set timer
take note and read the last note
browse in google
open specific web page
search in wikipedia
tell a weather in given city
